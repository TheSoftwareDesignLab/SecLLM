        <p>
          Generative Artificial Intelligence, and in particular Large Language
          Models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents, have significantly changed the way
          how we (humans) perform our daily activities; features like being able
          to establish smart conversations with and without context, as well as
          their capabilities for answering questions from any kind and domain is
          attracting more attention from the researchers and practitioners
          communities because we need to understand and assess the weaknesses
          and strengths of the models. For instance, hallucination is a
          well-known issue in LLMs, as well as the possibility of providing
          inappropriate questions when the models lack filters or are biased or
          poisoned. Previous work has been devoted to asses LLMs under different
          contexts and scenarios, e.g., code generation. However, few studies
          have been done in the context of information security; to our
          knowledge, no previous work has analyzed the quality of answers
          provided by LLMs to cybersecurity-related questions. Therefore, we
          present a dataset of questions extracted from StackExchange, including
          their top-10 answers and the ones generated by three GPT models
          (3.5-Turbo, 4-4o) for 5K+ questions; the dataset also includes
          similarity metrics (e.g., ROUGE, SacreBLUE, BERTScore) of the
          LLM-based answers when compared to the human-accepted ones.
        </p>

        <h1>Dataset</h1>

        <p>
          This section introduces SecLLM, a dataset comprising the more reviewed
          security-related questions on Stack Exchange- from 2010 to 2023. The
          dataset includes a total of 5,023 questions, along with their
          corresponding answers â€” both the original, user-submitted answers and
          responses generated by various versions of the popular large language
          model GPT.
        </p>

        <img src="images/extraction.png" alt="Stack Exchange" />

        <p>
          The dataset was constructed by extracting the questions and other data
          from Stack Exchange using a XML file found in the Internet Archive.
          Then scrapping the data from it in order to get both questions and
          answers. Next, we used the GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o models to
          generate responses to the questions. Finally we used the ROUGE, BLEAU
          and BERTScore metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated
          responses, comparing them to the accepted human answers of each of the
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resulting dataset is composed of three
          <strong>storage mechanisms</strong>. The first one is a relational
          database using PostgreSQL, the database structucture is described down
          below.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second one is a JSON file that contains a list of questions, each
          questions contains the information of the question, the tags, the
          answers and the generated answers,as well as the metrics used to
          evaluate them. The third file is an xml file with the same structure
          as the JSON file.
        </p>

        <h2>Database Structure</h2>

        <img src="images/segptdata - public.png" alt="Database" />

        <p>As shown in the image above, the dataset consists in six tables:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Questions</strong>: Contains the questions extracted from
            Stack Exchange. This includes it's title, body and other fields that
            are useful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Answers</strong>: Contains the answers extracted from Stack
            Exchange, including the body and an id to know which question is
            being answered.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GeneratedAnswers</strong>: Contains the answers generated by
            the LLMs, here we include the body of the question as well as the
            model being used to generate the answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tags (& QuestionTag)</strong>: Contains the tags of the
            questions. Using this we provide a way of filtering by tags
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluation</strong>: Contains the metrics used to evaluate
            the quality of the generated answers against the accepted answers.
            This includes the ROUGE, BLEAU and BERTScore metrics.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Metrics and Statistics</h1>

        <p>
          All questions from Stack Exchange were reduced to a limited number of
          5023 questions, because the generation of answers with GPT has a
          monetary cost, the most popular questions from each year were
          selected, here is an histogram of the number of questions per year.
        </p>

        <img src="images/questions_year.png" alt="Histogram" />

        <p>
          The prompt used to generate the answers specifically asked that the
          answers were 250 words long, here is an histogram of the lenght of the
          final result.
        </p>

        <img src="images/answers_lenght.png" alt="Histogram" />

        <p>
          Next you can see how is the distribution of the metrics for each
          metric, and for each model used, to see how every model behaves in
          comparison to the others

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br />

          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>
            The new version of this product costs significantly less than the
            previous one!
          </dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>
          Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times.
          Why not?
        </p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>
          You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four
          spaces.
        </p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>
          If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting
          them:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so
            I<br />
            could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here
            in<br />
            the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying
            to<br />
            come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't want to sound like<br />
            I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't -
            you<br />
            just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my
            feet<br />
            as I should be in coming up with one.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
